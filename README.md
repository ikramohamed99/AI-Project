AUTOMATED RECOGNITION OF LETTERS AND WORDS USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process of converting images of printed or handwritten text into machine-readable text data . The purpose is to taken in and processes input text images, train the
system to recognise the data and produce an output of the recognised text. The main stages of OCR is pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification and post-processing. OCR turns images
of texts into searchable and editable documents. Hence, OCR has many practical applications such as number plate recognition, historic document digitisation and is an accessibility tool for vison impaired
users when used in conjunction with voice over facility to read books or other documents. My implementations of text recognition is based on the OCR model.

Therefore OCR systems have an invaluable practical worth offering better search and retrieval functionality that has not been possible before. However, text detection with OCR poses its own set of
problems. Varying languages, fonts and styles in texts as well as issues with background clutter and irregular illumination make OCR a difficult problem.
